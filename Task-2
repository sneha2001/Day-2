Write a blog on the difference between document and window objects 
The Window Object:
The window object is a global object in the browser environment, representing the browser window or tab. 
It serves as the entry point to the browser's environment and provides access to various properties and methods that relate to the browser itself.
Some key aspects of the window object include:
1.Global Scope:
The window object is at the top of the browser's scope chain.
Variables and functions declared without the var, let, or const keyword become properties of the window object.
2.Browser Information:
Properties like window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight provide information about the dimensions of the browser window.
Other properties, such as window.location and window.navigator, offer details about the current URL and browser environment.
3.Timers and Intervals:
The window object is used for functions like setTimeout and setInterval to execute code after a specified delay or at regular intervals.
The Document Object:
On the other hand, the document object is part of the window object and represents the HTML document loaded in the browser. 
It provides an interface for interacting with the content of the document, allowing developers to manipulate the structure and style of the page.
Key features of the document object include:
1.DOM Manipulation:
The document object is central to DOM manipulation. Developers can use methods like getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector to select and modify HTML elements.
2.Content Modification:
The document object enables the addition or removal of HTML elements and content dynamically. Methods like createElement and appendChild are commonly used for this purpose.
3.Event Handling:
Through the document object, developers can attach event listeners to specific HTML elements. This facilitates the creation of interactive web pages by responding to user actions.
